## Wolfknight Plate Reader & Radar Compatibility

Support for Wolfknight Radar & Plate Reader
https://github.com/WolfKnight98/wk_wars2x

Plate reader automatically locks and alerts Police if:

* Vehicle owner is Wanted
* Vehicle owner has no drivers licence
* Vehicle has a BOLO

**IMPORTANT:**

* Ensure you set "CONFIG.use_sonorancad = true" in wk_wars2x/config.lua

This reduces the plate reader events to player's vehicles and doesn't query the database for hundreds of NPC vehicles

- **My dispatch calls are not being populated?** - You have not started the dispatch resource before the mdt or renamed the dispatch resource name and not made the necessary changes in mdt to reflect that.
